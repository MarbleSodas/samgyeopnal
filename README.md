Samgyeopnal is a project that I've made to simply share and discover home recipes. I made this because I often am incapable of deciding what to make for dinner and I hope this website can help me with this. In my desperate attempts at pulling up recipes online, I realized that those recipe websites are ridiculously difficult to navigate, and having a more streamlined approach to displaying recipe information could be helpful. 

This website features many things, such as the ability to search for posts based on user, tags, or post content. The functionality to view peoples' profiles and their posts, log in with Google authentication (maybe adding other forms of authentication soon). Change usernames, create posts, delete posts, and edit posts.

The current features that I am working on with this web app are, implementing multiple tags per post, images for posts, opening a specified post popup onPress with the option to open in a new tab, share post feature, implementing liking posts and sharing posts, and saving posts to collections
